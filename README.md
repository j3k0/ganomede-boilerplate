# ganomede-wordsaxe

Wordsaxe rules microservice.

Relations
---------

The wordsaxe module will:

 * Compute the game state as it should be after a valid move.
 * Create new game states
    * To do so: read dictionaries of words from `ganomede-data`

Configuration
-------------

 * `DATA_PORT_8080_TCP_ADDR` - IP of the data service
 * `DATA_PORT_8080_TCP_PORT` - Port of the data service
 * `BUNYAN_LEVEL` â€” [log level](https://github.com/trentm/node-bunyan#levels), defaults to `INFO`.
